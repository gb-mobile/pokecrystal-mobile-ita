# Information
An Italian translation of https://github.com/gb-mobile/pokecrystal-mobile-eng
This translation was performed via text dumps and a (somewhat) sophisticated find/replace script.
It is possible that some menus were missed by the find/replace script, and need translating manually.

## Setup [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

For more information, please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

After setup has been completed, you can choose which version you wish to build.
To build a specific version, run this command inside the repository directory in cygwin64:

`make`


Other languages are being worked on, but are not complete and still require a lot of polish.

## Using Mobile Adapter Features

To take advantage of the Mobile Adapter features, we currently recommend the GameBoy Emulator BGB:
https://bgb.bircd.org/

and libmobile-bgb:
https://github.com/REONTeam/libmobile-bgb/releases

Simply open BGB, right click the ‘screen’ and select `Link > Listen`, then accept the port it provides by clicking `OK`.
Once done, run the latest version of libmobile for your operating system (`mobile-windows.exe` or windows and `mobile-linux` for linux).
Now right click the ‘screen’ on BGB again and select `Load ROM…`, then choose the pokecrystal-mobile `.gbc` file you have built.
